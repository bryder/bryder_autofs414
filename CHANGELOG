16/12/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p50
---------------------------
   Added LDAP_DEPRECATED for the autofs-ldap-auto-master build. It segfaults on SuSE without it

13/10/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p49
---------------------------
   Added another error to the retryable errors list
     "server down"
   Seen on kubuntu 7 with massive overload on a test fileserver

28/07/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p48
---------------------------
   version tweak to debian control file (never tagged this one so I've shoved it in the p49 update)
   
28/07/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p47
---------------------------
   Added another error to the retryable errors list
     "mount system call failed"
   Seen on kubuntu_10_04_64 with 2.6.31.12-xxxx-20100212

28/07/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p46
---------------------------
   Added another error to the retryable errors list
     "nfs bindresvport: Address already in use"
   Seen this on our kubuntu 7 machines.

28/07/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p45
---------------------------
  All this was done to make life easier making a debian build
  Added .version file to make non rpm builds a bit easier
  Added .autofs-4.1.4 to make non rpm builds easier (in fact it won't configure without it for some reason)
  Fixed problem in init script on debian machines (missing variables in the debian section)

19/07/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p44
---------------------------
  Fix a problem where automount can shut itself down for no good reason.
  The case I had was  very high speed amount of failed mounts triggering the
      if (handle_packet() && errno != EINTR) ; break  
  piece of code in automount.c:handle_mounts which ended up just shutting down the automounter.
  The debug statement confirmed it (ap.state was 1 (READY) instead of 6 (SHUTDOWN))
  The bug is triggered if a child signal is caught when the daemon was not in the middle of a system call - hence errno 
  was not set to EINTR and handle_packet returned non zero - as in when a mount point didn't exist. 
  This was  reproducible when using the ignore-stupid-paths option which meant the daemon spent
  more time in user space handling autofs kernel packets than before.

  
15/07/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p43
---------------------------

  Added automount(pid to the ignore stupid paths list.

  Samba will look for this path when it tries to get quotas on mount points.
  I know I should fix samba but for now I'm adding it to the hacks I've already done for stupid paths.
  Of course stupid paths should not be hardcoded - I should use regexs etc etc.

14/07/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p42
---------------------------
 Adds retrying to nfs mounts. This is required because I've seen mount bursts when a job starts where the number 
 of reserve ports can be depleted and all that needs to be done is wait a little bit and mount again.
 You can work around this by using insecure ports to mount NFS things but I prefered doing it this way.
 
 Also we get retryable errors when the fileservers get really busy. The errors it retries on are defined in daemon/spawn.c
 
 	"RPC: Remote system error - Connection refused", /* heavy fileserver load */
 	"RPC: Timed out", /* heavy fileserver load */
 	"RPC: Remote system error - Connection timed out", /* heavy fileserver load */
 	"Input/output error", /* too many mounts starting at once on a client  - centos 2.6.18 */
 	"can't read superblock", /* too many mounts starting at once on a client - 2.6.25.18 and others */ 
 
 The options are --max-nfs-mount-retries|-R  and --nfs-mount-retry-pause|-P options
 
 The pause is chosen at random between 1 second and the retry-pause amount + 1

01/07/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p41
---------------------------
 Adds the -I or --ignore-stupid-paths option.
 
 The kernel nicely formats the path to mount up so that there are no extraneous dots or anything in it.
 And it's just the part relative to the top level automount
 
 The -I option makes the automount daemon  return a fail to the kernel for any path with a '*' in it or if the path 
 begins with a dot. It does this before it forks so it's very fast.
 
 The '*' paths are very annoying when you use ldap because it will match a lot of mount points and the first thing returned 
 by the search will be mounted  as /toplevelthing/*. 
 
 The .blahblah paths are excluded because when serving NFS out to OSX and Windows via SAMBA we've found that OSX in 
 particular will try to open a .directoryname for every directoryname in a mountpoint when browsing. This can be slow 
 when ghosting is on and you have a lot of mount points. Using this option it takes 0.001s more or less 
 to return a fail, without it it takes around 0.04s on the machine I tested. Mainly because the autmounter 
 forks before looking up the path. So 140 directories will delay you around 6s when a finder visits that top level automounter.
 

29/06/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p40
---------------------------
  Reinstates the ldap-cleanup.patch from 4.1.3 which does MUCH better LDAP schema handling. 
  It only looks up the schema once and then remembers it for every requested path under a mount point.
  It  includes the --use_old_ldap_lookup or -u option to make the code search every schema every time the way it used to.
  bryder changed the original patch is to invert the search order so the most modern schema (rfc2307bis) is checked first
  bryder added the option to the man page and help output from automount.c


29/06/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p39
---------------------------
 bryder patch to add function name to lookup_ldap.c debug and info and critcal statements

29/06/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p38
---------------------------
- Applied modifed no-unlink-upstream patch from kernel.org - prevents removals of files when removing a monted dir. bryder changes are cosmetic debug changes

29/06/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p37 
---------------------------

  bryder did various init script and sysconfig (for redhat but also will work for debian) autofs chanes
  Changed rc.autofs to have a UNCHECKED_DAEMONOPTIONS environment variable  this is unparsed and prepended to any daemon map options
  Changed debian handling of LOCALOPTIONS and DAEMONOPTIONS to match the redhat way (ie checks for overrides etc)
  And updated documentation in the sample /etc/sysconfig/autofs file which can be used as a /etc/default/autofs file in debian


29/06/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p36
--------------------------
 bryder changed from 4.1.3 redhat patch
  bryder changed /dev/random to /dev/urandom. /dev/random is far too slow.
  This patch adds the --random-multimount-selection or -r option which prevents the automounter from testing each mount point for performance.
  One is selected at random. 
  bryder added manpage update and added the option to the help output

  NOTE p34 below is actually p35 - p34 is the patch to update this changelog. Am sick of shuffling my commits so won't fix it.


16/06/2010 autofs-4.1.4-p34
---------------------------
 bryder dumpmap 4.1.3 port - doesn't do the hack for the lookup_files. Works for us though.
 The dumpmap patch adds the --dumpmap or -D argument to dump maps read by the daemon - then the daemon exits.
 Added help to the automount.c command for this option and updated the man page

  of using nonstrict option.
- updated autofs4 kernel module patches.


10/11/2003 autofs-4.1.0-beta3
-----------------------------

- I'm aware of one outstanding problem with multi-mount maps. The
  senario is that the daemon cannot remount a manualy umounted multi-mount
  entry until after the following expire event. This is due kernel module
  and daemon not knowing the umount has occured and consequently not
  cleaning up afterward. This causes the kernel module to return a longer
  path than it should which cannot be matched in the map. I hope to be able
  to fix this a some time in the future.
- removed debug print to catch reported mount problem.
- added patch to ignore failed mounts in tree mounts.


14/10/2003 autofs-4.1.0-beta2
-----------------------------

- added debug print to catch reported mount problem.
- updated autofs4 patches and their documention.
- added autofs4 patch for 2.4.22.


29/9/2003 autofs-4.1.0-beta1
----------------------------

This is a restructuring and improvement of my original v4 patch which added
direct mount support for file and NIS maps.
                                                                                
As well the considerable restructure and tidy up of my original patch it
includes:
                                                                                
- Merge of all the RedHat autofs v3 patches. This includes the RedHat
  init script and LDAP improvements. See the README files in the package
  for more info.
- Add LDAP direct mount support to complement the file and NIS map direct
  mount support already present.
- Merged some patches from the Debian and SuSE autofs v4 packages.
- Found a bunch of bugs and fixed them. This was largely due to the huge
  efforts made by Aaron Ogden in testing a never ending stream of attempted
  corrections. Thanks Aaron.


29/09/2003 autofs-4.0.0-1
-------------------------

Largely the autofs-4.0.0pre10 with:
- Some patches that I did ages ago to improve submounts. This includes
  correcting the double slash in mount points. Changes to the init script
  to improve the shutdown when submounts are involved.
- Merged some small patches from the Debian and SuSE autofs v4 packages.
- A simple work around to allow tree mounts to work with RedHat 2.4.20,
  and above, kernels in the autofs4 module patch.
