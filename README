autofs is a kernel-based automounter for Linux.  It performs a job
similar to amd(8) but relies on a small stub of kernel code instead of
pretending to be an NFS server.  The result is simpler code, better
reliability, and much faster operation in the common case (everything
already mounted.)

An AMD/AutoFS HOWTO is available at:

http://www.Linux-Consulting.com/Amd_AutoFS/autofs.html

... as well as from your favourite HOWTO archive.

To build autofs, please run:

	./configure

to configure the system.  See README.options for options that you can
give configure.

After configuring, you can:

	make			... make the daemon and modules
	make install		... install the daemon and modules

Development kernels 2.3.41 and onwards contain the autofs4 as
standard.  If you're using 2.2, you can apply the patch in
the patches directory; it was made from 2.2.14, but it should
work on 2.2.10 onwards. Patches related to extensions written
by Ian Kent are also in the patches directory. See README.ghosting
for a description of the kernel patches.

If you use autofs as a module, you need to add "alias autofs4 autofs"
to your modules config file (/etc/modules.conf or /etc/conf.modules).

Limited direct mount functionality has been implemented and a
describtion of what can be done can be found in README.direct.

autofs was written by H. Peter Anvin of Transmeta Corporation, please
read the COPYRIGHT file.  autofs 4 is the result of Jeremy
Fitzhardinge's <jeremy@goop.org> work on autofs 3. Further enhancements
have been made by Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>.
